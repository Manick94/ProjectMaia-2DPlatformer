Project Maia - 2D Platformer
============================

Project Maia is my personal project for the purpose of learning game development using Unity. It is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, taking some inspiration from games like [Maple Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_0hm9Xj5dQ) and the original [Metroid series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1V0YMULGs).
